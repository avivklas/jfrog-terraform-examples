# AWS VPC and EC2 Instance Example
The work here assumes you have an AWS account and have the AWS CLI installed and configured.

The [main.tf](1.aws-vpc-and-ec2/main.tf) contains the configuration that Terraform will use to create the resources in the cloud.

Initialize the Terraform configuration by running the following command
```shell
terraform init
```

Plan the Terraform configuration by running the following command
```shell
terraform plan
```

Apply the Terraform configuration by running the following command
```shell
terraform apply
```
